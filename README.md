# Reinforcement Learning & Intelligent Cart -> Master's degree Thesis

This application will create an environment for training a DQN algorithm.

Scenario: self driven shopping cart following a leader in a store.

## Abstract 
An important aspect of human cooperation with robots is that a robot should be able to state the intentions of its human collaborator in an easy way. This communication of intentions often requires the generation of clear trajectories of motion. The concept of legible movement is not usually studied in conjunction with machine learning. By combining these areas, we want to improve cooperation between humans and robots. This paper presents a control of the leader-follower type formation of mobile robots in environments scattered with obstacles. The tracking robot must distinguish the obstacles using reinforcement learning implemented by the DQN algorithm.
